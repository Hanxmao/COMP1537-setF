                            href="">Egyptological pronunciation</a> <b>Tutankhamen</b>
                        (/ˌtuːtənˈkɑːmɛn/)<sup>[6]</sup> (c. 1341 – c. 1323 BC), commonly referred to as <b>King
                            Tut</b>, was an Egyptian pharaoh
                        who was the last of his royal family to rule during the end of the 18th Dynasty (ruled c. 1332 –
                        1323 BC
                        in the conventional chronology) during the New Kingdom of Egyptian history. His father is
                        believed to be
                        the pharaoh Akhenaten, identified as the mummy found in the tomb KV55. His mother is his
                        father's
                        sister, identified through DNA testing as an unknown mummy referred to as "The Younger Lady" who
                        was
                        found in KV35.<sup>[7]</sup></p>

                    <p>Tutankhamun took the throne at eight or nine years of age under the unprecedented viziership of
                        his
                        eventual successor, Ay, to whom he may have been related. He married his paternal half-sister
                        Ankhesenamun. During their marriage they lost two daughters, one at 5–6 months of pregnancy and
                        the
                        other shortly after birth at full-term.<sup>[8]</sup> His names—Tutankhaten and Tutankhamun—are
                        thought to mean
                        "Living image of Aten" and "Living image of Amun", with Aten replaced by Amun after Akhenaten's
                        death. A
                        small number of Egyptologists, including Battiscombe Gunn, believe the translation may be
                        incorrect and
                        closer to "The-life-of-Aten-is-pleasing" or, as Professor Gerhard Fecht believes, reads as
                        "One-perfect-of-life-is-Aten".

                        Tutankhamun restored the Ancient Egyptian religion after its dissolution by his father, enriched
                        and
                        endowed the priestly orders of two important cults, and began restoring old monuments damaged
                        during the
                        previous Amarna period. He reburied his father's remains in the Valley of the Kings and
                        relocated the
                        capital from Akhetaten back to Thebes. Tutankhamun was physically disabled with a deformity of
                        his left
                        foot along with bone necrosis that required the use of a cane, several of which were found in
                        his tomb.
                        He had other health issues including scoliosis and had contracted several strains of malaria.

                    <p>Tutankhamun, whose original name was Tutankhaten or Tutankhuaten, was born during the reign of
                        Akhenaten, during the late Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt.<sup>[12]</sup> Akhenaten's reign was
                        characterized by a dramatic shift in ancient Egyptian religion, known as Atenism, and the
                        relocation of the capital to the site of Amarna, which gave its name to the modern term for this
                        era, the Amarna Period.<sup>[13]</sup> Toward the end of the Amarna Period, two other pharaohs
                        appear in the record who were apparently Akhenaten's co-regents: Neferneferuaten, a female ruler
                        who may have been Akhenaten's wife Nefertiti or his daughter Meritaten; and Smenkhkare, whom
                        some Egyptologists believe was the same person as Neferneferuaten but most regard as a distinct
                        figure.<sup>[14]</sup> It is uncertain whether Smenkhkare's reign outlasted Akhenaten's, whereas
                        Neferneferuaten is now thought to have become co-regent shortly before Akhenaten's death and to
                        have reigned for some time after it.<sup>[15]</sup></p>
